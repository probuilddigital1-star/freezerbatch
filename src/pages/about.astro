        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <p>
          You're hosting. Friends are arriving. You want to serve cocktails that aren't
          embarrassing, but you also want to actually talk to your guests instead of
          shaking drinks all night.
        </p>

        <p>
          The solution has existed for decades in professional bars: batch your cocktails
          ahead of time. But until recently, the math was either guesswork or required
          a bartender's intuition built over years.
        </p>

        <h2>The Solution</h2>
        <p>
          We built this calculator to do the math for you. Enter your recipe, and we'll
          tell you exactly how much to pour off, how much to add back, and whether your
          creation will actually stay pourable in a standard home freezer.
        </p>

        <p>
          No more guessing. No more slushy disasters. Just perfectly chilled cocktails,
          ready when you are.
        </p>

        <h2>The Science We Stand On</h2>
        <p>
          Everything here is grounded in real chemistry and real bartending experience.
          We consulted with professional bartenders (30+ years of fine dining experience)
          to validate our calculations and recommendations.
        </p>

        <p>Key principles:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>22%+ ABV</strong> keeps cocktails pourable at standard freezer temperatures</li>
          <li><strong>20-25% dilution</strong> replaces what ice would normally contribute</li>
          <li><strong>Fresh ingredients matter</strong>, especially vermouth and citrus</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What We're Not</h2>
        <p>
          We're not affiliated with any liquor brands. We're not selling anything except
          honest recommendations (with affiliate links clearly marked). We're not claiming
          to have invented freezer door cocktails. That credit goes to bartenders who've
          been doing this for generations.
        </p>

        <p>
          We just built a calculator that does the math correctly.

        <h2>Affiliate Disclosure</h2>
        <p>
          Some links on this site are affiliate links to Amazon. If you buy something
          through these links, we may earn a small commission at no extra cost to you.
          This helps keep the site running and the calculator free.

        <p>
          We only recommend products we'd actually use. If something's on this site,
          it's because it's good, not because the commission is high.
